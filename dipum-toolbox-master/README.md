# DIPUM Toolbox 3

DIPUM Toolbox 3 contains MATLAB functions that were created for the book *Digital Image Processing Using MATLAB*, 3rd edition, by R.C. Gonzalez, R.E. Woods, and S.L. Eddins, Gatesmark, 2020.  The functions supplement and extend the image processing functionality of [MATLAB](https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html) and [Image Processing Toolbox](https://www.mathworks.com/products/image.html), 
both offered by [MathWorks](https://mathworks.com).

For other information and support files for *Digital Image Processing Using MATLAB*, see the associated [website](http://imageprocessingplace.com).

## License

DIPUM Toolbox is copyright 2002-2020 Gatesmark. It is provided under what is known as the *BSD-3-Clause* open-source license. See the [license file](https://github.com/dipum/dipum-toolbox/blob/master/LICENSE.txt) for details.

Note that some functions in the DIPUM Toolbox are provided under separate open-source licenses. See the `license.txt` files in the relevant folders.

## Requirements

This release of the DIPUM Toolbox works with R2016b or later of MATLAB and Image Processing Toolbox.  The DIPUM Toolbox is not supported for use with earlier versions of MATLAB or Image Processing Toolbox. Most DIPUM functions require Image Processing Toolbox.

The DIPUM Toolbox works with all MATLAB platforms.  It includes one MEX-file (UNRAVEL, which is used for Huffman decoding).  Compiled binaries for this MEX-file are provided for all MATLAB platforms.
