% Requirements
% ------------
% This release of the DIPUM Toolbox works with R2016b or later of MATLAB
% and the Image Processing Toolbox.  The DIPUM Toolbox is not supported
% for use with earlier versions of MATLAB or the Image Processing
% Toolbox.  Most DIPUM functions require the Image Processing Toolbox.
%
% The DIPUM Toolbox works with all MATLAB platforms.  It includes one
% MEX-file (UNRAVEL, which is used for Huffman decoding).  Compiled
% binaries for this MEX-file are provided for all MATLAB platforms.
%
% Installation
% ------------
% To install the DIPUM Toolbox, go to
% https://github.com/dipum/dipum-toolbox/releases and download the
% latest dipum-toolbox.mltbx file. In MATLAB, navigate to the folder
% containing the downloaded file and double-click on it in the MATLAB
% Current Folder Browser. An installer will open to guide you through
% the installation process.
%
% Alternatively, download the latest code from the DIPUM Toolbox
% repository, https://github.com/dipum/dipum-toolbox, and add all the
% code folders to the MATLAB Search Path. In the MATLAB HOME tab, click
% on Set Path. Then, click on "Add with Subfolders..." and select the
% top-level folder containing the DIPUM Toolbox files.
